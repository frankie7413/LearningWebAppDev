1. Build a site that will allow users to post questions and answers. Each question and its 
	answers expire after 10 minutes have passed since the question was posted. After a 
	question expires, it's no longer active. A user can visit the site, browse through 
	currently active questions, respond to questions, or post new questions of their own. 
	
2. Answers API by Yahoo, Blogger Data API by Google, Google Web Fonts API, OpenSocial by 
	Google, and Web Notifications.

3. Answers API - The Answers API lets you access the collective knowledge contained 
	within Yahoo! Answers. You can search Answers based on a variety of criteria 
	(including specific user, category, and more), set your app to watch for new questions 
	in the categories you choose, and track new answers from specific users.
	
   Blogger Data API - The Blogger Data API lets your application create and post new blog 
   posts, edit or delete existing posts, and search for posts based on specific criteria.
	
   Google Web Fonts API - The Web Fonts API makes it easy to add free web fonts to your 
   website or application. Their collection of fonts grows on a continuous basis and 
   already includes a huge variety.
	
   OpenSocial - OpenSocial can be used for building social applications, creating social 
   app platforms, and sharing and accessing social data.
   
   Web Notifications - Web notifications defines an API for end-user notifications. A 
   notification allows alerting the user outside the context of a web page of an 
   occurrence, such as the delivery of email.
	
5. The api would be helpful for people asking questions about movies and people answering 
	the questions can use the api to fact check or look up actors, movies, movie dates, etc.

6. The implementation and maintenance of the API could outweigh its need. Also, the api 
	could be replaced with a simple google search. 
	
7. The api had a lot of helpful documentation and we should implement it into our project 
	in the answering section to help people answer questions to look up movie facts easily. 
	
8. The example was very basic and had hard coded movie information to go by; however, we 
	could expand the implementation to include searching for other movie titles, actors, 
	directors, year made, etc. all the information helpful for people to answer questions. 
	Furthermore, this can be used to adding other apis that contain movie, book, media 
	information for users to quickly look up.
